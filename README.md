- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clavoie1 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about code and queries.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning through various tutorials and LinkedIn resources.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: IDK how fun this is, but I'm interested in fantasy (reading, shows like Wheel of Time) and RPGs (Final Fantasy and other games, MTG, D&D, Gloomhaven) as well as social justice and equality and find a significant intersection between those topics.
